# Ada-Checkers-Term-Project
# Term Project for ITCS 4102 - Survey of Programming Languages

This project creates and runs a two-player Checkers game in the programming language Ada, specifically using Ada 2012. The program uses an extension called JEWL to create the GUI. The Ada IDE, GNAT, was used to create and test this project.

# What I Learned From This Project
The main thing that I learned from this project was how to use the Ada programming language, specifically Ada 2012. I found that this programming language, while definitely older, can still perform fairly well when it comes to solving modern-day problems. 

After this project, I have come to the conclusion that Ada does not perform well for video games (Checkers, in this case) and would perform much better in a mission/time -critical scenario. While Ada did not perform at it's best for this project, I definitely have gained a deep respect for this language and it's capabilities.
